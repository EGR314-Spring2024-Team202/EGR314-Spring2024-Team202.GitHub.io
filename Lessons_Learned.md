# Lessons Learned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When working on a big project like this where there are multiple parts coming together to make one product, failure should be expected. We experienced multiple failures with our project, and have not failed to learn from them. Whether it be soldering a backup PCB, or ordering more parts once our main ones broke, we did not shy away from doing everything we could to succeed. One early failure that we experienced was that our board was small and did not have many areas for debugging, this made it difficult to find issues on the board and ultimately required the team to damage the board to make it work. From this, we learned to design our PCBs with backups such as adding via we could us to jump wires onto the board. Another problem we faced was that the PIC we chose did not have enough pins for us to comfortably work with it. This caused issues when it came to making sure that everything was connected. To fix this, we had to order another PIC and learn how to use it which ended up costing us time. This loss of time frustrated us, but we were able to perservere thanks to the standards we held ourselves to as a team.

# Advice for Future Students
1. Always plan for failure 
2. Choose your parts carefully
3. Design your PCB so that you can change it after it is printed.
4. Check your teammates' work. 
5. Order enough backup parts for multiple devices
