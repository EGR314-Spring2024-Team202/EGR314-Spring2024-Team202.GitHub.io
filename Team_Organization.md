# Team Organization

## Goals

Our focus centers on advancing our expertise in embedded system design for future projects. We are dedicated to creating and integrating subsystems to make one over arching system work while effectively trouble shooting problems during the process. Our team looks to further increase our knowledge and capabilities of implementation and trouble shooting when it comes to our subsystems. From a technical stand point we strive to increase our abilities to work along side other as well as developing important and effective products. We look to foster more of an open mind to allow for the most effective and proffessional group enviornment.

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to empower individuals and communities with real-time environmental insights. With a focus on innovation, user satisfaction, we envision a future where our product contributes to informed decision making, and environmental awareness.

## Communcation Channels 

Our team communication channels is mainly text and discord. Our contact information as well as our roles and meeting schedule can be found in [Appendix A](/Appendix_A.md)

## Communication Procedures

The team will primarily text for ongoing discussions and employ in-person meetings, Discord messages, for communication. In case of an emergency, team members are told to call one another. If a team member fails to attend class, it is the on the student that missed class to communicate with the team or ask the professor for information. Team members will stay in regular communication with the professor, and the designated team recorder will act as the primary intermediary to facilitate effective interaction. This simplified approach is designed to improve teamwork and project efficiency.
