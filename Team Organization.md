# Team Organization

## Goals

Our focus centers on advancing our expertise in embedded system design for future projects. We are dedicated to creating and integrating subsystems to make one over arching system work while effectively trouble shooting problems during the process. Our team looks to further increase our knowledge and capabilities of implementation and trouble shooting when it comes to our subsystems. From a technical stand point we strive to increase our abilities to work along side other as well as developing important and effective products. We look to foster more of an open mind to allow for the most effective and proffessional group enviornment.
