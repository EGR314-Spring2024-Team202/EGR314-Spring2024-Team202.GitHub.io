|“The thing lasted for 2 and a half months and the unit <br>battery died. So I bought a new battery, climbed <br>up a ladder again, installed the battery and reinstalled <br>the new one. Came back in the wind speed still did not work”|1.Reliability, the customer expresses dissatisfaction with the weather station’s performance.

|“I used the weather station successfully for monitoring <br>wind and outside temperatures at home. However, I <br>experienced issues with two outdoor wind/temp units, both displaying the same failure mode after a short period of operation. The problem, indicated by a 'low battery' message, persisted even after following support staff recommendations, including replacing <br>the battery. Attempts to troubleshoot RF communication issues were also unsuccessful. <br>Despite returning the original unit and receiving a replacement, the problem persisted.”|1.Easy to set up (Latent) <br>2.The screen is easy to read (Explicit) <br>3.Must keep a strong WIFI connection (Latent)|
|“Like other reviews, the outside sending unit doesn't charge <br>the battery properly. I am unable to go up on my roof to change the battery and have to <br>ask a friend to do it. The battery needs to be changed every two to three months and going up on <br>the roof isn't happening in the winter.
This product is a complete waste of money.”
