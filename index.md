## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our project, SmartBreeze, is intended to function as an adaptive cooling system that is portable and provides the user with the ability to control their environment. We accomplished this goal by coordinating together on a series of exercises meant to enable us to create a functioning prototype of our design. In order to work together as a team, we first needed to define how we would structure our team, and the rules we expected each other to follow. We then moved on to analysing our user base to find reviews that would give us much needed direction for our product. From there, we came up with a series of designs that were constructed from turning the user needs we found into workable design requirements. We chose a design we thought we could assemble within our stated deadlines, and proceeded to finding the parts we would need to build the device. We created a diagram that displayed the various interactions between our components, and drew out how we thought the device would operate for the user. After that we used Cadence to create a circuit and PCB that would ideally function in the way that we laid out, and once it was manufactured, assembled and programmed it to be able to function the way we desired.
