# Microcontroller Selection Process
Here's the systematic process our team followed to select the microcontroller for our product. We initiated by establishing requirements that aligned with both our needs and the project specifications. After defining these criteria, we deliberated and identified our top three choices. Subsequently, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of each microcontroller's features, using their capabilities as the basis for our ranking
